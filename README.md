# Pursuit-Core-iOS-KVO-Lab

Build an app that models the example that Apple explains [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html)

## Functionality:

Create a Tab Bar Controller with 3 View Controllers.  Use KVO to pass information (i.e don't reload the whole Users' Information View Controller on viewWillAppear).

### VC 1: Create User View Controller

- Create a user with a given user name and starting account balance

### VC 2: Deposit / Withdrawels View Controller

- Make a deposit to a given user's account
- Make a withdrawel from a given user's account

### VC 3: Users' Information View Controller

- View the account balance of each stored user
